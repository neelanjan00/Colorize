# Colorize
Colorize is a computer vision algorithm which is implemented as a feed-forward pass in a CNN at test time, that has been trained on a million images from the Imagenet dataset. 

The algorithm is able to fill vibrant and realistic colors to the black and white images to recreate a plausible colorized image. Based on the 2016 research paper by Zhang et al. "Colorful Image Colorization".
